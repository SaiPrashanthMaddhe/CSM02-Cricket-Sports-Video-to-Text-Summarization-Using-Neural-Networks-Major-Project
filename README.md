**Cricket Video-to-Text Summarization Using Neural Networks:**
This project introduces an innovative approach that focuses on extracting key highlights and events of a
cricket match, to generate a concise textual summary by utilizing advanced neural networks. The
proposed system aims to outperform and overcome the limitations of traditionally summarizing
systems. The proposed system uses a combination of various technologies like VGG16 Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs), Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Long Short-Term Memory
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to build a powerful neural network architecture. This system
allows transforming visual cues into short textual summaries that can be easily understandable by
varied categories of viewers
